Task Overview:
This project has been developed as part of a practical learning exercise to explore real-time communication in web applications. 
The goal of this task is to build a Real-Time Chat Application using modern web development technologies including React for the frontend and Socket.IO for real-time communication.
This chat application allows users to send and receive messages instantly. The application simulates features found in real-world chat systems, 
including live message updates without page refreshes, and smooth communication between multiple users.
The key focus of this task is to understand how WebSockets work, and how client-server communication can be implemented using event-driven architecture.
Users interact with a responsive chat UI where they can enter their name, type a message, and send it to the chat room. 
All connected users can see the conversation in real-time, mimicking modern messaging platforms.

Objectives of the Task:
The main objectives of this project are:

To understand and implement real-time communication using WebSockets.

To build a responsive and functional chat interface using React.

To implement Socket.IO on both client and server sides for real-time message exchange.

To demonstrate event-based programming for live user interaction.

To simulate a real-world chat system used in messaging apps and support systems.

Features of the Application:
Live Messaging:
Messages sent by one user are received instantly by all connected users without refreshing the page.
User Identification:
Users can input their name to personalize their messages.
Message Broadcasting:
All messages are broadcasted to every connected client in the same chat room.
Responsive Design:
The chat interface works well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
React-Based UI:
Smooth, dynamic interface using component-based structure.
Scroll to Latest Message:
The chat automatically scrolls to the latest message.

Learning Outcome:
This project gave me hands-on experience in building real-time web applications. I learned how WebSockets work, 
and how to create a full-duplex connection between client and server using Socket.IO. I also improved my skills in:
Building responsive UIs with React
Managing state and rendering components dynamically
Implementing real-time features with minimal latency
Structuring a project with a separate client-server architecture
This project helped me simulate a real-time system, similar to WhatsApp, Messenger, or customer support chats, 
and prepared me to implement such features in production-level applications.

Task Status:
This real-time chat application has been successfully completed and tested. All functionalities are working as expected. 
The complete project is available in the GitHub repository with organized source code for both client and server sides.
